MODULE M7	PRODUCING THE WEB BASED SOLUTION          

1.	Rationale
•	It is necessary for you to demonstrate that you can produce a web based solution that can satisfy a business to business or a business to customer application
•	It is important that you can demonstrate that you can follow a formal development process
•	It is necessary for you to provide documentation of your web based solution that facilitates easy subsequent maintenance.

2	Scope
The solution should cover as a minimum the following
•	Web page design
•	Security log-on
•	Database maintenance
•	Reporting systems
•	Web Hosting

3.	Documentation
Must be professional. The documentation of your web based solution will demonstrate your abilities to a prospective employer. A piece of work that is of the standard produced by a major software house will mark you out as a practitioner rather than an amateur. It is strongly recommended that you follow a formal structure: sample technical documentation headings, overleaf.


4.	Action Points
•	Review design issues from earlier units.
•	Try to take a staged approach so that you get a simple solution fully working before attempting a more complex solution. This way, if you run out of time before you complete the complex version, you will, nevertheless, have a working solution.
•	Remember the importance of testing
•	Leave time for uploading the web pages onto the server and to test them again once they are in situ.

5.	Do’s and Don’ts
•	Concentrate on usability rather than technical complexity.
•	Maintain good organisation of documentation

6.	Best Sources for Help

•	Refer to Website Design Notes
•	Look at professionally produced documentation.
